# In-Motion-License-Plate-Detection
This project develops a real-time system for detecting and recognizing number plates on moving vehicles. Using advanced image processing and machine learning, it aims to enhance traffic monitoring, law enforcement, and automated toll collection by accurately identifying vehicle license plates under various conditions.

IN THIS PROEJECT WE ARE USING 2 YOLO MODELS IN WHICH YOLOV8N.PT IS A PRE-TRAINED MODEL & LICENSE-PLATE-DETECTOR IS OUR DEVELOPED MODEL.

Here you should download any moving vehicles video and rename it to sample.mp4, then you should upload that video to above repository.
